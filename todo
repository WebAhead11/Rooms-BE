Omar:

1. install npm
2. install express packages
3. install postgresql and build a database
4. build essential files and folders needed for 1,2,3

database password (UNIX password) : Roomsbe11
use "npm run dev" to run

got this error: "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module"
--> how to fix: "type": "module" in package json as the system requires
-->
"(node:658) Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension."
now the server works perfectly :)

I am not sure I had the database done well.
